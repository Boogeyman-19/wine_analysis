# Wine Analysis Project

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing a wine dataset to uncover insights regarding wine quality, based on various chemical properties. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and applying machine learning models to predict wine quality.

The dataset used for this analysis contains information on both red and white wine samples, with features such as acidity, sugar content, alcohol levels, and more.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pip

### Required Libraries
You can install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The main libraries used are:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
- `jupyter` for running notebooks (if applicable)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from [Wine Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). It includes the following features:
- **Fixed acidity**
- **Volatile acidity**
- **Citric acid**
- **Residual sugar**
- **Chlorides**
- **Free sulfur dioxide**
- **Total sulfur dioxide**
- **Density**
- **pH**
- **Sulphates**
- **Alcohol**
- **Quality** (target variable)

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-analysis.git
   cd wine-analysis
   ```

2. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the Jupyter notebook and explore the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run the preprocessing and modeling scripts:
   ```bash
   python src/preprocess.py
   python src/model.py
   ```

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and normalizes the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes relationships between features and wine quality.
- **Machine Learning**: Uses models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict wine quality.
